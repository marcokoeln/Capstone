    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Every day, about 3,700 people die in road traffic worldwide. Road traffic accidents are an increasing problem even in times of modern vehicle technology and well-developed infrastructure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.35 million people die in traffic accidents every year. According to the Federal Statistical Office, the causes of traffic accidents involving personal injury in Germany are:\n",
    "- _Driver mistakes_\n",
    "- _Road conditions, weather influences, obstacles_\n",
    "- _Technical defects_\n",
    "- _Incorrect pedestrian behavior_\n",

    "The dataset used is based on a document called 'Collisions—All Years' from the organisation 'SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group'. It includes all types of collisions counted by the Seatle Police Department and Traffic records in the city of Seatle, WA in the timeframe beginning 2004 until present. The document is weekly updated. The project purpose is to analyze and predict the severity of an accident based on some particular features as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __INATTENTIONIND__ Whether or not collision was due to inattention. (Y/N)\n",
    "- __UNDERINFL__ Whether or not a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n",
    "- __WEATHER__ A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision.\n",
    "- __ROADCOND__ The condition of the road during the collision.\n",
    "- __LIGHTCOND__ The light conditions during the collision.\n",
    "- __SPEEDING__ Whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision. (Y/N)\n"
